# wifi
Laptop wireless NIC troubleshooting application trying various methods to reconnect.

I originally designed this for wifi connections that were once connected but for one reason or another was disconnected and attempting to reconnect.
Still have tons to work on and clean up.

To-do
* Write function for ping test.
* Clean up output to stdout.
* Check for other networking issues
  * dns, net config, ping gw, test other site besides google.com, etc
* Add comments.
